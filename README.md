# Fidakune Language Project

**Fidakune is a constructed language designed for global communication, trust, and collaboration.**

This repository hosts the official requirements document and foundational planning for the Fidakune language. Our mission is to create a shared second language that is exceptionally easy to learn, culturally neutral, and robust enough to handle complex topics like climate science, diplomacy, and cross-cultural collaboration.

## Our Vision

In a world facing complex, shared challenges, clear communication is essential. Fidakune was born from the idea that a logically designed, universally accessible language can be a powerful tool for human connection. By removing linguistic barriers, we hope to foster a global community capable of solving problems together.

## üöÄ Quick Start

New to Fidakune? Start here:

1. üìñ **Read our first story** to see Fidakune in action.
2. üî§ **Learn your first words** from our [Foundational Vocabulary](LEXICON.md).
3. üí¨ **Join the conversation** in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/jlillywh/Fidakune-Language/discussions).
4. üåü **Subscribe to our [Substack](https://substack.com/@jlillywh)** for weekly stories and updates.

## ‚ú® See Fidakune in Action

Here is a simple but powerful example of Fidakune's expressive philosophy:

**"Hope gives strength"**

* **Fidakune:** `sole-lum pa don forsa`
* **Pronunciation:** `/Ààso.le.lum pa don Ààfor.sa/`
* **Literal:** "sun-light past give strength"

üëÜ *Notice how the metaphorical compound `sole-lum` (sun-light) creates the concept of "hope." This aligns with our design principle of expressive capacity through compounding. The `SVO` word order and pre-verbal tense particle `pa` demonstrate the language's simple, regular grammar.*

## Core Principles

Fidakune's design is guided by five key principles:

* üß† **Cognitive Simplicity:** A grammar so regular it has zero exceptions.
* üó£Ô∏è **Articulatory Ease:** A sound system built from the most common phonemes across world languages.
* üé® **Expressive Capacity:** A simple structure that serves as a canvas for rich, emotional, and artistic expression.
* üåç **Cultural Neutrality:** A design that avoids bias toward any single language family or culture.
* ü§ù **Collaborative Evolution:** A framework for the language to grow with its community.

## Project Documentation

The core documentation for this project provides a complete blueprint for the language.

* **[GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md):** Outlines the project's leadership structure and the phased plan for transitioning to community governance.
* **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md):** A guide for how to get involved and contribute to the project effectively.
* **[LEXICON.md](LEXICON.md):** Organization and development of Fidakune's vocabulary system.
* **[TESTING.md](TESTING.md):** Testing metrics framework for evaluating learnability and accessibility.

## Community Tools

* **[Idea Submission App](https://jlillywh.github.io/Fidakune-Language/submit-ideas.html):** Mobile-friendly Progressive Web App for submitting vocabulary, gesture, and feedback ideas. Supports multilingual interface and offline functionality.
* **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/jlillywh/Fidakune-Language/discussions):** Collaborate on ideas, testing, and cultural neutrality with the global Fidakune community.
* **[Substack Newsletter](https://substack.com/@jlillywh):** Subscribe for short stories, idioms, and language learning content in Fidakune.

### Current Status

**Version 0.13 (Design Phase, Months 1-6)**

The project is currently in its early design stages. The core requirements have been defined, and we are actively seeking feedback as we move toward prototyping the vocabulary, learning materials, and digital tools.

Key activities include:
- **Testing**: Engaging 50 learners from 10 language families
- **Development**: Drafting the guidebook and prototyping the digital lexicon
- **Timeline**:
  - **Months 7-18**: Develop 1,000 words, beta test tools
  - **Months 19-24**: Finalize tools
  - **Year 3-4**: Launch in 10 community settings

## How to Contribute

Fidakune is a language for everyone, built by everyone. We welcome contributions from linguists, developers, artists, educators, and anyone passionate about global communication.

1.  **Read the Documentation:** Start by familiarizing yourself with the `REQUIREMENTS.md` and `GOVERNANCE.md` files.
2.  **Review the Contribution Guidelines:** Our `CONTRIBUTING.md` file has everything you need to know to get started.
3.  **Check the Issues:** Visit the [Issues tab](https://github.com/jlillywh/Fidakune-Language/issues) to see ongoing discussions, feature requests, and areas where we need help.

We are particularly looking for feedback on:

* **Vocabulary Development:** Suggest words like `sky-net` for internet
* **Accessibility:** Propose WCAG 2.1-compliant features for learning tools
* **Cultural Neutrality:** Review phonology and gestures for bias
* **Learning Materials:** Contribute to guidebook exercises

**Priority Areas for Feedback:**
- **Vocabulary Development**: Suggest new words (e.g., `sky-net` for internet)
- **Accessibility**: Propose WCAG 2.1-compliant features
- **Cultural Neutrality**: Review phonology and gestures
- **Learning Materials**: Contribute to guidebook exercises
