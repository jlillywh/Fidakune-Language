<!-- 
Guidelines for Relationship Types:

**is_a (Direct Translation)**
- Direct semantic equivalence between Fidakune and English
- Example: "pet" is_a "stone"
- Strength typically 0.8-1.0

**has_root (Root Component)**
- Morphological composition relationships
- Example: "kore-pet" has_root "pet"
- Strength typically 0.9-1.0 for direct roots

**is_related_to (Conceptual Association)**
- Semantic or conceptual connections
- Example: "kore-pet" is_related_to "sadness"
- Strength varies based on conceptual distance (0.3-0.9)
