# Fidakune Digital Lexicon System

## Architecture Overview

This document outlines the technical implementation of the Fidakune digital lexicon system with bidirectional linking between compound words and their roots.

## System Components

### 1. Data Schema (`lexicon_system/schema.py`)

**Core Data Structure:**
```python
@dataclass
class LexiconEntry:
    word: str                          # The word itself
    pronunciation: str                 # IPA pronunciation
    definition: str                    # Word definition
    domain: str                       # Semantic domain
    pos_type: str                     # Part of speech
    word_type: WordType               # ROOT or COMPOUND
    roots: Optional[List[str]]        # Required for compounds
    derived_words: Set[str]           # Bidirectional linking
    etymology_note: Optional[str]     # Compound explanation
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Enforces mandatory `roots` field for compound words
- ✅ Automatic validation of entry consistency
- ✅ JSON serialization/deserialization support
- ✅ Legacy format migration capabilities

### 2. Graph-Based Lexicon Manager (`lexicon_system/lexicon.py`)

**Core Technology:** NetworkX directed graph for relationship modeling

**Key Functionality:**
- ✅ Bidirectional relationship tracking
- ✅ Efficient compound-to-root navigation
- ✅ Root-to-derived-words queries
- ✅ Derivation chain analysis
- ✅ Domain and pattern-based search
- ✅ Comprehensive statistics generation

**Performance Characteristics:**
- O(1) word lookup
- O(k) root/derived word queries (k = number of relationships)
- Scalable to 1,200+ words

### 3. Web Interface (`lexicon_system/webapp.py`)

**Framework:** Flask with CORS support

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /word/<word>` - Word detail page with hyperlinks
- `GET /api/word/<word>` - JSON API for word data
- `GET /api/search` - Search functionality
- `GET /browse` - Browse interface with filters
- `GET /compound/<word>` - Detailed compound analysis

**Hyperlinking Implementation:**
- ✅ Each root word in compound displays as clickable link
- ✅ Navigates directly to root word entry
- ✅ Bidirectional navigation (roots show derived words)
- ✅ Responsive, mobile-friendly interface

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Core Dependencies
- `networkx>=3.0` - Graph-based relationship modeling
- `flask>=2.3.0` - Web framework for API and interface
- `flask-cors>=4.0.0` - Cross-origin request support

### Migration Process
```bash
# Migrate existing lexicon to enhanced format
python migrate_lexicon.py
```

### Running the Web Interface
```bash
# Start development server
python -m lexicon_system.webapp lexicon_enhanced.json
```

## Acceptance Criteria Status

- Clean, accessible link styling
- Mobile-responsive design

### ✅ Bidirectional Linking
- `derived_words` field automatically populated
- Efficient queries for words derived from any root
- Graph-based relationship modeling
- Real-time relationship updates

### ✅ Scalability
- O(1) lookup performance
- NetworkX graph optimization
- Tested with 1,200+ word capacity
- Efficient memory usage

### ✅ Technical Requirements Met
- JSON data format for machine readability
- NetworkX for graph modeling
- Flask for web API and interface
- Comprehensive test suite included

## Example Usage

### Basic Lexicon Operations
```python
from lexicon_system.lexicon import FidakuneLexicon

# Load lexicon
lexicon = FidakuneLexicon()
lexicon.load_from_legacy_json("lexicon.json")

# Get word details
entry = lexicon.get_entry("sole-lum")
print(f"Definition: {entry.definition}")
print(f"Roots: {entry.roots}")

# Find derived words
derived = lexicon.get_derived_words("lum")
print(f"Words using 'lum': {derived}")
```

### Web Interface Access
```
# Word detail pages (with hyperlinks)
http://localhost:5000/word/sole-lum
http://localhost:5000/word/sole
http://localhost:5000/word/lum

# API endpoints
http://localhost:5000/api/word/sole-lum
http://localhost:5000/api/search?q=hope
http://localhost:5000/api/stats
```

## Testing

### Run Test Suite
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest test_lexicon_system.py -v

# Run acceptance criteria tests only
python test_lexicon_system.py
```
