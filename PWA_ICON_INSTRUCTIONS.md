# PWA Icon Placeholder

Since I cannot generate actual image files, you'll need to create two PNG icons:

## icon-192x192.png
- Size: 192x192 pixels
- Content: Simple "F" logo or "Fidakune" text
- Background: White or light blue
- Format: PNG

## icon-512x512.png  
- Size: 512x512 pixels
- Content: Same design as 192x192 but larger
- Background: White or light blue
- Format: PNG

You can create these using:
- Canva (free online tool)
- GIMP (free software)
- Any image editor

Simple design suggestion:
- White background
- Blue circle with white "F" in center
- Or just "Fidakune" text in blue on white background

Upload these files to the repository root after creating them.
