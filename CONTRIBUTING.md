# Contributing to Fidakune

Fidakune is a collaborative project to build a universal second language. We welcome contributions from linguists, developers, educators, artists, and enthusiasts. This document outlines how to contribute, ensuring a respectful and inclusive community, in alignment with [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) and [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md).

Thank you for considering contributing to Fidakune! This project is a community effort, and every contribution, from a typo fix to a new vocabulary proposal, helps us achieve our shared vision.

## Code of Conduct

To ensure a welcoming and inclusive environment, we ask all contributors to adhere to our Code of Conduct. In short:

* **Be Respectful:** Treat everyone with respect. Healthy debate is encouraged, but personal attacks, harassment, or exclusionary behavior will not be tolerated.
* **Be Inclusive:** Welcome people of all backgrounds, identities, and experience levels.
* **Be Collaborative:** Work together constructively. Remember that the goal is to build a better language for everyone.

A full `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file will be added to the repository shortly.

2. **Use the Mobile App:** Submit ideas quickly via our [Idea Submission App](submit-ideas.html) for vocabulary, gestures, or feedback. The app supports multiple languages and works offline.
3. **Explore Issues:** Check the [Issues](https://github.com/jlillywh/Fidakune-Language/issues) tab for open tasks, such as vocabulary proposals, gesture feedback, or bug reports.
4. **Submit Feedback:** Open an issue with a clear title using one of these prefixes:
   - **[VOCAB PROPOSAL]:** Suggest new words (e.g., `sky-net` for internet, `/skai.net/`).
   - **[BUG REPORT]:** Report issues in documentation or tools (e.g., broken links in `REQUIREMENTS.md`).
   - **[FEEDBACK]:** Share general suggestions, cultural insights, or accessibility improvements.
5. **Contribute Code or Content:** Fork the repository, create a branch (e.g., `vocab-sky-net`), make changes, and submit a pull request with a clear description.

## Examples of Contributions

- **Vocabulary:** Propose `sky-net` (/skai.net/) for "internet" via an issue, specifying its semantic domain (Technology).
- **Gestures:** Suggest accessibility alternatives (e.g., a facial expression for the "Yes" nod).
- **Testing:** Share feedback on phonology (e.g., /É¾/ pronunciation for tonal language speakers) or digital tools.
- **Translations:** Contribute to translations of `README.md` or guidebook exercises in languages like Spanish or Mandarin.

## Vocabulary Proposals

To propose a new word for the Fidakune lexicon:

1. **Open an Issue:** Use the `[VOCAB PROPOSAL]` prefix with these details:
   - **Word:** The proposed Fidakune word (e.g., `sky-net`)
   - **Pronunciation:** IPA notation (e.g., `/skai.net/`)
   - **Meaning:** Clear definition (e.g., "internet, global computer network")
   - **Semantic Domain:** Category (e.g., Technology, Nature, Society, Emotion, Grammar)
   - **Justification:** Why this word is needed and how it fits Fidakune's principles

2. **Phonotactic Compliance:** Ensure your proposal follows the sound rules in [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) Section 4.2
   - Permitted syllable structures: V, VC, CV, CVC
   - Allowed consonant clusters: /st/, /pl/, /pr/, /tr/, /sp/
   - No tonal distinctions

3. **Non-Technical Submissions:** Email proposals to fidakune.contact@gmail.com with the same information

4. **Review Process:** The core team (Phase 1) or Language Council (Phase 2) will review proposals for:
   - Phonotactic compliance
   - Cultural neutrality
   - No homophony with existing words
   - Semantic clarity and usefulness

Current vocabulary is maintained in [lexicon.json](lexicon.json) and will grow from ~200 words (current) to 1,200 words by Month 18.

## Accessibility

All contributions, including issues and documentation, should align with WCAG 2.1 standards (e.g., clear headings, alt text for diagrams). Non-technical contributors can use email to ensure accessibility for all.
