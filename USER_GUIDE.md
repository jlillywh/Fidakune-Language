## Getting Started

### What is Conceptual Exploration?

Traditional search finds words that match your query. Conceptual exploration reveals the **network of meaning** around words, showing you:

- **Direct translations** between Fidakune and English
- **Root components** that build compound words
- **Related concepts** that share semantic connections

### Your First Search

1. **Enter a word or concept** in the search box
   - Try "kore-pet" (grief), "aqua" (water), or "hope"
   - Works with both Fidakune words and English concepts

2. **Explore the results** organized in three categories:
   - üéØ **Directly Related Concepts** - exact meanings and translations
   - üîó **Component Roots to Consider** - building blocks of compound words
   - üí≠ **Related Ideas** - conceptually connected words

3. **Click any result** to explore its relationships
   - Each click starts a new exploration from that concept
   - Use breadcrumbs to track your exploration path

### Example: Exploring "kore-pet" (grief)

When you search for "kore-pet", you'll discover:

- **Directly Related**: "grief" (English translation)
- **Component Roots**: "kore" (heart) and "pet" (stone)
- **Related Ideas**: concepts like "sadness" and "sorrow"

This reveals that Fidakune expresses grief as "heart-stone" - a beautiful metaphor showing how the language builds meaning!

## Understanding Conceptual Relationships

### The Three Types of Connections

#### üéØ Directly Related Concepts (is_a relationships)
These are **direct translations** and **exact meanings**:
- "aqua" is_a "water"
- "sole" is_a "sun"
- "ami" is_a "friend"

**When to use**: When you want to know exactly what a word means.

#### üîó Component Roots to Consider (has_root relationships)
These show the **building blocks** of compound words:
- "kore-pet" has_root "kore" (heart)
- "kore-pet" has_root "pet" (stone)
- "sole-lum" has_root "sole" (sun) and "lum" (light)

**When to use**: When you want to understand how compound words are constructed or find other words that share the same roots.

#### üí≠ Related Ideas (is_related_to relationships)
These reveal **conceptual connections** and **semantic associations**:
- "grief" is_related_to "sadness"
- "water" is_related_to "sun" (both natural elements)
- "heart" is_related_to "emotion" (conceptual domain)

**When to use**: When you want to explore the broader conceptual landscape around a word.

### Connection Strength

Each relationship has a **strength indicator** showing how closely connected the concepts are:

- **Strong connections** (‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè) - Very direct relationships
- **Medium connections** (‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óã‚óã) - Clear but less direct relationships  
- **Weak connections** (‚óè‚óã‚óã‚óã‚óã) - Distant but meaningful relationships

## How to Search and Explore

### Search Strategies

#### 1. **Direct Word Search**
- Search for specific Fidakune words: "aqua", "kore", "sole-lum"
- Search for English concepts: "water", "heart", "hope"

#### 2. **Concept Exploration**
- Start with a broad concept like "emotion" or "nature"
- Follow the connections to discover related vocabulary
- Use the breadcrumb trail to navigate back

#### 3. **Root Discovery**
- Search for root words like "kore" or "pet"
- Explore what compound words use these roots
- Understand the systematic nature of Fidakune word-building

### Navigation Patterns

#### **Linear Exploration**
Follow a single path of connections:
water ‚Üí aqua ‚Üí nature ‚Üí sole ‚Üí sun ‚Üí light

#### **Radial Exploration**
Explore all connections from one central concept:
```
        sadness
           ‚Üë
grief ‚Üê kore-pet ‚Üí heart
           ‚Üì
        stone
```

#### **Comparative Exploration**
Compare how different languages express similar concepts:
- English "hope" vs Fidakune "sole-lum" (sun-light)
- English "grief" vs Fidakune "kore-pet" (heart-stone)
