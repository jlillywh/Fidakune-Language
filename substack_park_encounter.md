# When Strangers Become Friends: A Fidakune Encounter in the Park

*By Fida Nenesbury*

Last week, something magical happened that perfectly captures why we're building Fidakune. I was walking through Central Park when I overheard two people having a conversation—not in English, Spanish, or Mandarin, but in Fidakune. Two complete strangers, connecting through our constructed language in the most natural way possible.

I had to share their exchange with you because it shows Fidakune doing exactly what it was designed to do: breaking down barriers and creating instant human connection.

## The Scene

Picture this: A sunny afternoon in Central Park. Maya, a college student from Seoul visiting New York, is sitting on a bench looking a bit lost with a map in her hands. David, a local artist walking his dog, notices her confusion. Neither speaks the other's native language fluently, but both have been learning Fidakune.

What happened next was pure linguistic magic.

**David:** *[approaching with his dog]* **"Bon sole, no?"** *(Good sun, no?)*

**Maya:** *[looking up, surprised but smiling]* **"Si! Bel sole."** *(Yes! Beautiful sun.)*

**David:** *[pointing to himself]* **"Mi David. Tu?"** *(I David. You?)*

**Maya:** **"Mi Maya. Tu spek Fidakune!"** *(I Maya. You speak Fidakune!)*

**David:** *[grinning]* **"Si, mi spek. Tu vel help?"** *(Yes, I speak. You want help?)*

**Maya:** *[holding up map]* **"Mi vel go... dis place."** *[points to museum on map]* *(I want go... this place.)*

**David:** **"Ah! Mi see. Dat der."** *[pointing north]* **"Wi go?"** *(Ah! I see. That there. We go?)*

**Maya:** *[hesitating]* **"Tu gud ami?"** *(You good friend?)*

**David:** *[laughing, gesturing to his friendly golden retriever]* **"Dis dog bon. Mi bon ami."** *(This dog good. I good friend.)*

**Maya:** *[petting the dog]* **"Bel anim! How... tu name?"** *(Beautiful animal! How... you name?)*

**David:** **"Dog name 'Sole'—like sun. Tu like?"** *(Dog name 'Sole'—like sun. You like?)*

**Maya:** **"Mi amor Sole! Kam, wi go."** *(I love Sole! Come, we go.)*

## What Made This Magical

As I watched this unfold (yes, I may have followed them for a few blocks—for research purposes!), I was struck by several things:

**The Simplicity Worked**: Neither Maya nor David had perfect Fidakune grammar, but they communicated perfectly. The language's simple SVO structure and regular patterns made it easy for them to express complex ideas with basic vocabulary.

**Cultural Neutrality in Action**: David's American directness and Maya's Korean politeness both came through naturally in Fidakune. The language didn't force either of them to adopt unfamiliar cultural communication patterns.

**Compound Creativity**: When Maya wanted to ask if David was trustworthy, she instinctively used "gud ami" (good friend) rather than struggling with a complex concept. This is exactly how Fidakune's expressive compounding is supposed to work.

**Universal Gestures**: Both speakers naturally supplemented their words with pointing, smiling, and gestures. Fidakune isn't just spoken—it's a full communication system that includes the visual layer we're developing.

## The Linguistic Details That Mattered

For those interested in the technical aspects, this conversation showcased several key Fidakune features:

**Phonetic Accessibility**: Maya, a Korean speaker, had no trouble with Fidakune's 20-phoneme system. David, an English speaker, found the consistent CV syllable structure easy to pronounce clearly.

**Flexible Word Order**: When Maya said "Tu vel help?" instead of the more standard "Tu vel help mi?" the meaning was perfectly clear from context—exactly as Fidakune is designed to work.

**Semantic Transparency**: The word "sole" (sun) for the dog's name was immediately understood by Maya, even though it was being used as a proper noun. This demonstrates how Fidakune's vocabulary builds on itself.

## The Human Connection

But here's what really moved me: by the time they reached the museum, Maya and David were laughing together, sharing photos of their respective cities, and planning to meet up again. They'd exchanged contact information and were already making plans to practice Fidakune together.

Two strangers, from different continents, different native languages, different cultures—connected instantly through a language that didn't exist five years ago.

## What This Means for Fidakune's Future

This spontaneous encounter validates everything we've been working toward:

**Real-World Usability**: Fidakune isn't just a theoretical construct—it's a practical communication tool that works in actual human interactions.

**Learning Curve Success**: Both speakers were clearly beginners, yet they communicated effectively. This suggests our 20-hour basic proficiency goal is realistic.

**Cultural Bridge-Building**: The conversation flowed naturally without either speaker having to abandon their cultural communication style.

**Community Formation**: Most importantly, Fidakune created an instant bond between two people who might never have connected otherwise.

## Try It Yourself

Inspired by Maya and David's encounter? Here are some simple Fidakune phrases to get you started:

- **"Bon sole!"** - Good sun! (Great weather!)
- **"Mi [your name]. Tu?"** - I'm [your name]. You?
- **"Tu spek Fidakune?"** - Do you speak Fidakune?
- **"Wi ami!"** - We friends!
- **"Bel!"** - Beautiful!

The beauty of Fidakune is that even with just these five phrases, you could start a meaningful interaction with another learner anywhere in the world.

## The Bigger Picture

Maya and David's park encounter represents something profound: the emergence of a truly global auxiliary language. Not imposed by any government or corporation, but chosen freely by individuals who want to connect across linguistic boundaries.

Every week, I hear more stories like this. Fidakune conversations happening in coffee shops in São Paulo, university campuses in Mumbai, and now parks in New York. Each interaction proves that our vision of a shared second language for global communication isn't just possible—it's already happening.

The future of human connection might just sound like two strangers saying "Bon sole!" on a beautiful afternoon.
