# Fidakune Lexicon Organization

This document outlines the organization and structure of Fidakune's vocabulary system, supporting the collaborative development of a 1,200-word foundational vocabulary as specified in [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) Section 4.4.

## Current Vocabulary Status

- **Current Size:** ~10 words (see [lexicon.json](lexicon.json))
- **Target Size:** 1,200 words by Month 18
- **Growth Plan:** Core 200 words by Month 6, full vocabulary by Month 18

## Semantic Domains

Fidakune vocabulary is organized into logical semantic domains to ensure comprehensive coverage and cultural neutrality:

### Nature (Domain: `Nature`)
- `aqua` (/ˈa.kwa/) - water
- `sole` (/ˈso.le/) - sun
- `terra` (/ˈte.ra/) - earth, ground

### Society (Domain: `Society`)  
- `ami` (/ˈa.mi/) - friend
- `lei` (/ˈlei/) - law

### Emotion (Domain: `Emotion`)
- `kore-pet` (/ˈko.ɾe.pet/) - grief, deep sadness

### Grammar (Domain: `Grammar`)
- `fu` (/fu/) - future tense particle
- `pa` (/pa/) - past tense particle  
- `nok` (/nok/) - negation particle (not)
- `ri` (/ɾi/) - respect particle
- `le` (/le/) - aspect particle (completed action)

### Technology (Domain: `Technology`)
*Proposed words for future development:*
- `sky-net` (/skai.net/) - internet (proposed)

## Word Proposal Process

To maintain cultural neutrality and phonotactic compliance, new words must follow the process outlined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md):

1. **Semantic Domain Classification:** All words must fit into established domains
2. **Phonotactic Compliance:** Must follow syllable structures (V, VC, CV, CVC) and allowed clusters
3. **Cultural Neutrality Review:** Avoid loanwords from dominant languages
4. **Community Review:** Submit via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/jlillywh/Fidakune-Language/issues) with `[VOCAB PROPOSAL]` tag

## Development Priorities

**Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Core 200 Words**
- Basic nouns (nature, body parts, family)
- Essential verbs (go, have, be, see, eat)
- Common adjectives (big, small, good, bad)
- Numbers (1-10, basic quantities)
- Time expressions (day, night, now, before)

**Phase 2 (Months 7-18): Extended Vocabulary**
- Specialized domains (technology, science, arts)
- Complex concepts and abstract terms
- Cultural and social concepts
- Advanced grammar particles

## Governance and Quality Control

The [Fidakune Language Council](GOVERNANCE.md) (Phase 2) will oversee vocabulary development to ensure:
- Phonotactic compliance with Section 4.2 requirements
- Cultural neutrality per Section 3 design principles  
- No homophony with existing words
- Semantic clarity and usefulness
- Community input incorporation
