# Fidakune Lexicon

This document serves as the single source of truth for Fidakune's vocabulary system, defining the structure, principles, and governance framework for the language's lexicon. The Fidakune vocabulary is designed to facilitate global communication through culturally neutral terms that are accessible to speakers from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

## 1. Lexicon Principles

The Fidakune vocabulary is built on the foundational principle of **cultural neutrality**, ensuring that no single language family or cultural tradition dominates the lexicon. Words are derived from widely recognizable concepts rather than loanwords from specific languages, promoting equal accessibility for all learners.

### Core Design Features
- **Foundational vocabulary** of approximately **1,200 words**
- **Semantic domain organization** for systematic learning
- **Expandable framework** through community governance
- **Phonotactic compliance** with all vocabulary adhering to Fidakune's sound rules
- **Homophone avoidance** to prevent lexical confusion

The vocabulary is organized into logical semantic domains to facilitate systematic acquisition and provide clear conceptual frameworks for learners.

## 2. Semantic Domains

The Fidakune lexicon is structured around key semantic domains that cover essential human communication needs. Each domain contains core vocabulary items that serve as building blocks for more complex expression.

### Nature Domain
This domain encompasses natural phenomena, environmental concepts, and basic elements of the physical world.

**Examples:**
- `aqua` (water)
- `sole` (sun)

*[PLACEHOLDER: Full Nature domain word list to be appended here]*

### Society Domain  
This domain covers social relationships, institutions, and human interactions within communities.

**Examples:**
- `ami` (friend)
- `lei` (law)

*[PLACEHOLDER: Full Society domain word list to be appended here]*

### Additional Semantic Domains
*[PLACEHOLDER: Additional domain sections to be developed, including but not limited to:]*
- *Body and Health*
- *Food and Sustenance*
- *Time and Space*
- *Emotions and Mental States*
- *Technology and Tools*
- *Arts and Culture*
- *Numbers and Quantities*

*[PLACEHOLDER: Full word lists for all domains will be systematically appended to their respective sections]*

## 3. Expressive Compounding

Fidakune employs **metaphorical compounding** as a primary method for creating nuanced concepts and expanding expressive capacity without increasing the core vocabulary burden. This system allows speakers to combine existing words to create precise meanings while maintaining the language's principle of simplicity.

### Compounding Principles
- Compounds combine two or more existing lexical items
- The resulting meaning may be literal or metaphorical
- Compounds follow standard Fidakune phonotactics and stress rules
- Hyphenation is used in writing to clarify compound boundaries

### Official Example
`kore-pet` (heart-stone) → "grief"

This compound demonstrates metaphorical usage: combining `kore` (heart) with `pet` (stone) creates a poetic expression for grief, suggesting the heaviness or hardness that grief brings to the heart.

### Compound Formation Guidelines
- Compounds should be semantically transparent when possible
- Metaphorical compounds should draw on universal human experiences
- New compounds must avoid homophony with existing vocabulary
- Community input is encouraged for compound development

## 4. Proper Nouns

Proper nouns in Fidakune are adapted to conform to the language's phonological system while maintaining recognizability for global users.

### Adaptation Rules
- Proper nouns retain their original forms when phonotactically compatible
- Non-compatible proper nouns are adapted to Fidakune phonology
- Adaptations should preserve maximum recognizability
- Stress follows standard Fidakune rules (penultimate syllable)

### Official Example
**'Paris'** → **`Pa-ris`**

This adaptation demonstrates the process: the original name is modified to fit Fidakune's syllable structure while remaining clearly recognizable to speakers familiar with the original.

### Loanword Policy
**Loanwords are discouraged** to maintain the principle of cultural neutrality. The lexicon prioritizes:
- Culturally neutral terminology
- Universal concept-based vocabulary
- Compound formation over borrowing
- Community-developed alternatives to culture-specific terms

## 5. Governance Model for New Vocabulary

The Fidakune lexicon operates under a **community-driven governance model** designed to ensure democratic participation while maintaining linguistic integrity and consistency.

### Proposal Process
1. **Submission**: New vocabulary proposals are submitted via the digital lexicon platform
2. **Community Review**: Proposals undergo public review and discussion
3. **Technical Evaluation**: Linguistic experts assess phonotactic compliance and homophone conflicts
4. **Council Review**: The Fidakune Language Council evaluates proposals based on established criteria

### Fidakune Language Council
The Council comprises:
- **Linguists** with expertise in constructed languages
- **Community representatives** elected by active users
- **Accessibility experts** ensuring inclusive design

### Approval Criteria
New vocabulary must meet the following requirements:
- **Phonotactic compliance**: Adherence to Fidakune sound rules
- **Homophone avoidance**: No conflicts with existing vocabulary
- **Cultural neutrality**: Avoidance of culture-specific bias
- **Community support**: Demonstrated need and acceptance
- **Semantic clarity**: Clear, unambiguous meaning

### Voting Process
- **Community voting** determines initial support levels
- **Council deliberation** addresses technical and policy concerns
- **Final approval** requires Council consensus
- **Implementation** includes integration into official documentation and learning materials

### Review Cycle
The vocabulary undergoes systematic review every **two years** to:
- Assess usage patterns
- Identify gaps in coverage
- Propose refinements to existing terms
- Evaluate the effectiveness of new additions

All Council decisions are **documented and publicly accessible** on the digital platform, ensuring transparency in the governance process.
