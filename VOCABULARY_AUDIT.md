# Fidakune Vocabulary Audit - Cross-Cultural Accessibility Review

**Date:** August 6, 2025  
**Purpose:** Systematic review of current 206-word vocabulary for cross-cultural accessibility alignment

## Audit Methodology

This audit evaluates each word against our refined principles:
- **Cross-Cultural Accessibility:** Draws from patterns common across diverse language families
- **Phonological Consistency:** Adheres to the 20-phoneme inventory
- **Conceptual Clarity:** Uses widely recognizable concepts
- **Systematic Organization:** Maintains consistent derivation patterns

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Phonological Violations

**Words violating the 20-phoneme inventory:**
- `child` (/tʃajld/) - Contains /tʃ/ (not in inventory)
- `sharp` (/shaɾp/) - Contains /ʃ/ (not in inventory) 
- `long` (/loŋ/) - Contains /ŋ/ (not clearly defined in inventory)
- `wing` (/wiŋ/) - Contains /ŋ/ (not clearly defined in inventory)

**Recommended Actions:**
- `child` → `jun` (/jun/) - from widespread "young" concept
- `sharp` → `akut` (/a.kut/) - from widespread "acute" concept
- `long` → `larg` (/laɾg/) - from widespread "large" concept
- `wing` → `ala` (/a.la/) - from widespread concept

### 2. Language Family Bias

**Words favoring specific language families:**

**Latin/Romance bias:**
- `libertas` → `fre` (/fɾe/) - simplified "free" concept
- `cultura` → `kult` (/kult/) - simplified form
- `pensar` → `tink` (/tink/) - more universal "think"
- `saber` → `know` (/now/) - already exists as concept

**English bias:**
- `dream` → `som` (/som/) - from widespread "somnium" concept
- `app` → `prog` (/pɾog/) - "program" more universal
- `web` → `ret` (/ɾet/) - "network" concept already exists as `net`

### 3. Conceptual Duplicates

**Multiple words for same concept:**
- `bon` vs `gud` → Keep `gud` (more universal)
- `nov` vs `new` → Keep `nov` (fits phonotactics better)
- `vel` vs `vol` → Keep `vel` (simpler form)
- `kre` vs `krea` → Keep `kre` (simpler form)

### 4. Cultural Assumptions

**Family/relationship terms:**
- `wif`/`husban` → `part` (/paɾt/) - "partner" more inclusive
- Consider adding `ko-part` (/ko.paɾt/) - "co-partner" for spouse concept

**Recommended Systematic Approach:**
- Use `gen-part` (/gen.paɾt/) - "life-partner" 
- Use `fam-mem` (/fam.mem/) - "family-member" for relatives

## Proposed Refinements

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Immediate)
1. Fix phonological violations
2. Remove clear duplicates
3. Replace most biased terms

### Phase 2: Systematic Review (Next)
1. Standardize derivation patterns
2. Ensure semantic domain balance
3. Test with diverse linguistic communities

### Phase 3: Community Validation
1. Submit refined vocabulary for community review
2. Test with 50 learners from 10 language families
3. Iterate based on feedback

## Implementation Priority

**High Priority (Fix Immediately):**
- Phonological violations
- Clear duplicates
- Most obvious cultural bias

**Medium Priority (Next Phase):**
- Systematic pattern alignment
- Semantic domain rebalancing

**Low Priority (Community Phase):**
- Fine-tuning based on user feedback
- Advanced compound development

## Success Metrics

- 100% phonological compliance with 20-phoneme inventory
- No obvious language family bias in core vocabulary
- Clear, testable concepts accessible across cultures
- Systematic derivation patterns for compound formation
