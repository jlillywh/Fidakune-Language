### Title: Fidakune Language Project: Join Our Global Mission! üåç

Fidakune is a constructed language designed for global communication, with simple grammar (SVO, 9 particles), 20 phonemes, and neutral gestures. We're in Version 0.13, testing with 50 learners from 10 language families.

**Why Fidakune?**
- **Cognitive Simplicity**: No exceptions, easy to learn in 20 hours (Tier 1 proficiency)
- **Cultural Neutrality**: Phonology, vocabulary (e.g., `aqua` for water), and gestures (e.g., nod for "Yes") avoid bias
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1-compliant, with translations in 5 languages
- **Community-Driven**: Built via GitHub and our [Idea Submission App](https://jlillywh.github.io/Fidakune-Language/submit-ideas.html)

**Current Vocabulary (50 words):**
- Nature: `aqua` (water), `sole` (sun), `luna` (moon), `arbor` (tree)
- Grammar: `pa` (past), `fu` (future), `nok` (not), `ri` (respect)
- Society: `ami` (friend), `pax` (peace), `famil` (family)
- Technology: `data` (information), `tek` (technology), `net` (network)

**Get Involved:**
- **Explore**: Check out [REQUIREMENTS.md](https://github.com/jlillywh/Fidakune-Language/blob/main/REQUIREMENTS.md)
- **Test**: Try pronouncing `kore-pet` (/Ààko.…æe.pet/) or the "Yes" nod (see [TESTING.md](https://github.com/jlillywh/Fidakune-Language/blob/main/TESTING.md))
- **Contribute**: Propose words like `sky-net` via our [PWA](https://jlillywh.github.io/Fidakune-Language/submit-ideas.html) or [Discussions](https://github.com/jlillywh/Fidakune-Language/discussions)
- **Join**: Share ideas in [Issues](https://github.com/jlillywh/Fidakune-Language/issues) or email fidakune.contact@gmail.com

- **Vocabulary**: Currently 50 words across 8 semantic domains, targeting 1,200 words
- **Gestures**: 20 culturally neutral gestures for enhanced communication
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliant with multilingual support

**Seeking:**
- Phonologists to test pronunciation across language families
- Sociolinguists for cultural neutrality validation
- Accessibility experts for inclusive design review
- General linguistics feedback on structure and learnability

**Repository**: https://github.com/jlillywh/Fidakune-Language
**Testing Framework**: [TESTING.md](https://github.com/jlillywh/Fidakune-Language/blob/main/TESTING.md)
