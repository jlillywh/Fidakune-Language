## Part 1: The 5 Vowels

Fidakune uses five "pure" vowels - sounds that don't glide or change as you pronounce them. These vowels are found in languages around the world, making them familiar and easy to learn.

### Vowel A - /a/
**Letter:** `a`  
**Sound:** Like the 'a' in "father" or "car"  
[AUDIO: /a/ pronunciation]  
[DIAGRAM: Vowel /a/ - mouth open, tongue low and central]

**Practice:** Listen and repeat the sound /a/ three times.  
*[Interactive audio button: "Play /a/" with repeat function]*  
*[WCAG 2.1: Audio controls include play/pause, volume, and transcript: "Open central vowel sound"]*

### Vowel E - /e/
**Letter:** `e`  
**Sound:** Like the 'e' in "met" or "bed"  
[AUDIO: /e/ pronunciation]  
[DIAGRAM: Vowel /e/ - mouth half-open, tongue mid-front]

**Practice:** Listen and repeat the sound /e/ three times.  
*[Interactive audio button: "Play /e/" with repeat function]*

## Part 2: Your First Consonants

Now let's learn seven consonants that are common and easy to pronounce. These sounds appear frequently in Fidakune words.

### Consonant P - /p/
**Letter:** `p`  
**Sound:** Like the 'p' in "pin" or "spin"  
**How to make it:** Press your lips together, then release with a small puff of air

### Consonant N - /n/
**Letter:** `n`  
**Sound:** Like the 'n' in "no" or "sun"  
**How to make it:** Touch your tongue tip to the roof of your mouth and let sound come through your nose  
[AUDIO: /n/ pronunciation]  
[DIAGRAM: /n/ articulation - tongue tip at alveolar ridge, air through nose, alveolar nasal]

### Consonant S - /s/
**Letter:** `s`  
**Sound:** Like the 's' in "sit" or "kiss"  
**How to make it:** Put your tongue near the roof of your mouth and let air flow through the small gap  
[AUDIO: /s/ pronunciation]  
[DIAGRAM: /s/ articulation - tongue near alveolar ridge, air flow creates friction, voiceless alveolar fricative]

### Consonant H - /h/
**Letter:** `h`  
**Sound:** Like the 'h' in "hat" or "ahead"  
**How to make it:** Simply breathe out gently while starting to speak  
[AUDIO: /h/ pronunciation]  
[DIAGRAM: /h/ articulation - open vocal tract, gentle airflow, voiceless glottal fricative]

## Part 3: Word Stress - The Penultimate Rule

In Fidakune, stress (the emphasis you put on syllables) follows a simple, predictable rule that you never have to memorize for individual words.

### The Rule
**Stress always falls on the second-to-last syllable (penultimate syllable) in words with more than one syllable.**

### Examples Using Your New Sounds

Let's practice with words using only the sounds you've learned:

#### Two-Syllable Words
- `so-le` (sun) → **so**.le  
  *[Audio: /ˈso.le/ with clear stress on first syllable]*

- `ko-re` (heart) → **ko**.re  
  *[Audio: /ˈko.re/ with clear stress on first syllable]*

- `a-mi` (friend) → **a**.mi  
  *[Audio: /ˈa.mi/ with clear stress on first syllable]*

**Notice:** In two-syllable words, the stress falls on the first syllable because it's the second-to-last (penultimate) syllable.

### Why This Rule Helps
- **No memorization needed:** You always know where to put the stress
- **Consistent pronunciation:** Everyone stresses words the same way
- **Easy listening:** Predictable stress helps you understand spoken Fidakune

### Interactive Exercise: Stress Identification
*[WCAG 2.1 Compliant Exercise]*

**Instructions:** Listen to each word and identify which syllable is stressed. Click on the stressed syllable or use keyboard navigation.

1. **Word:** `pa-te` (hypothetical word)  
   *[Audio: /ˈpa.te/]*  
   **Which syllable is stressed?** 
   - [ ] pa (first syllable)  
   - [ ] te (second syllable)  
   *[Keyboard: Use arrow keys to select, Space to choose]*

2. **Word:** `mi-so` (hypothetical word)  
   *[Audio: /ˈmi.so/]*  
   **Which syllable is stressed?**
   - [ ] mi (first syllable)  
   - [ ] so (second syllable)

3. **Word:** `hu-na` (hypothetical word)  
   *[Audio: /ˈhu.na/]*  
   **Which syllable is stressed?**
   - [ ] hu (first syllable)  
   - [ ] na (second syllable)

*[Immediate feedback: "Correct! In two-syllable words, stress falls on the first syllable because it's the penultimate (second-to-last) syllable."]*
