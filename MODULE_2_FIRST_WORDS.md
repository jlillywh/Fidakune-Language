#### Important: Accessibility Rule for /ɾ/
**Don't worry if this sound is difficult!** Fidakune is designed to be accessible to everyone. If you find the alveolar tap /ɾ/ hard to pronounce, you can use either:

1. **Quick /d/ sound:** Pronounce it like a very quick 'd'
2. **Your native /r/ sound:** Use whatever 'r' sound is natural in your language

**Examples:**
- `kore` (heart) can be pronounced as:
  - /ˈko.ɾe/ (with tap) 
  - /ˈko.de/ (with quick d)
  - /ˈko.re/ (with your native r)

*All three pronunciations are correct and accepted!*

**Practice:** Try the /ɾ/ sound, then practice with your preferred alternative.  
*[Three audio buttons: "Tap version", "Quick d version", "Common r version"]*

## Part 3: Building Simple Sentences

Now comes the exciting part - making your first Fidakune sentences! Fidakune uses a simple, predictable word order that never changes.

### The SVO Rule
Fidakune follows **Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)** word order in all sentences:

**Subject** (who does it) + **Verb** (what they do) + **Object** (what/who receives the action)

This order never changes, making Fidakune sentences easy to understand and create.

### Your First Two-Word Sentences
Let's start with simple Subject-Verb sentences:

#### Example 1: mi go
**Structure:** Subject + Verb  
**Meaning:** "I go"  
[AUDIO: /mi go/ pronunciation]

**Breakdown:**
- `mi` = I (subject)
- `go` = go (verb)

#### Example 2: ami help
**Structure:** Subject + Verb  
**Meaning:** "Friend helps" or "The friend helps"  
[AUDIO: /ˈa.mi help/ pronunciation]

**Breakdown:**
- `ami` = friend (subject)
- `help` = help (verb)

### Your First Three-Word Sentences
Now let's add objects to create complete SVO sentences:

#### Example 3: mi help ami
**Structure:** Subject + Verb + Object  
**Meaning:** "I help friend" or "I help the friend"  
[AUDIO: /mi help ˈa.mi/ pronunciation]

**Breakdown:**
- `mi` = I (subject)
- `help` = help (verb)
- `ami` = friend (object)

#### Example 4: ami help mi
**Structure:** Subject + Verb + Object  
**Meaning:** "Friend helps me" or "The friend helps me"  
[AUDIO: /ˈa.mi help mi/ pronunciation]

**Breakdown:**
- `ami` = friend (subject)
- `help` = help (verb)
- `mi` = me (object)

### Interactive Exercise: Sentence Building
*[WCAG 2.1 Compliant Exercise]*

**Instructions:** Build correct Fidakune sentences by arranging the word tiles in SVO order. Drag and drop the tiles or use keyboard navigation.

#### Challenge 1
**Create the sentence meaning "I go"**

#### Challenge 2  
**Create the sentence meaning "Friend helps me"**

*[Word tiles: `help`, `ami`, `mi`]*  
*[Drop zone: _____ _____ _____]*

#### Challenge 3
**Create the sentence meaning "I help friend"**

*[Word tiles: `mi`, `ami`, `help`]*  
*[Drop zone: _____ _____ _____]*

*[Immediate feedback provided: "Correct! This follows SVO order: Subject (mi) + Verb (help) + Object (ami)"]*

### Sentence Pattern Practice
*[Interactive audio exercise]*
