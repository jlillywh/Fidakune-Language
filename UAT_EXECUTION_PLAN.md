1. Load lexicon-search.html on mobile device
2. Test portrait and landscape orientations
3. Verify touch targets are at least 44px
4. Test search input and button functionality
5. Verify result cards display properly
6. Test "Propose New Word" button

**Expected Results:**
- Interface adapts to screen size
- All elements are touch-accessible
- Text remains readable at all sizes
- No horizontal scrolling required

**Devices to Test:**

### TC-003: Accessibility Compliance Validation

**Objective:** Verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and screen reader compatibility

**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate using only keyboard (Tab, Enter, Arrow keys)
2. Test with screen reader enabled
3. Verify focus indicators are visible
4. Test high contrast mode
5. Test with reduced motion enabled
6. Verify ARIA labels and live regions

**Expected Results:**

### TC-004: GitHub Integration Validation

**Objective:** Verify GitHub issue creation workflow functions correctly

**Test Steps:**
1. Perform a search that returns no results
2. Click "Propose a New Word" button
3. Verify GitHub issue opens in new tab
4. Check that search context is pre-populated
5. Verify issue template fields are present
6. Test mandatory checkbox functionality

**Expected Results:**
- GitHub issue opens in new tab with noopener/noreferrer
- Search context included in issue body
- All template fields present and functional
- Mandatory checkbox prevents submission when unchecked

**Browsers to Test:**
- [ ] Chrome (desktop)

2. Test with network disconnection
3. Test with invalid search queries
4. Test with very long search queries
5. Test rapid successive searches
6. Test browser back/forward navigation

**Expected Results:**
- Graceful degradation with slow connections
- Appropriate error messages for network issues
- Invalid queries handled without crashes
- Long queries rejected with helpful message
- Rapid searches don't cause conflicts
- Navigation maintains application state

**Network Conditions to Test:**
