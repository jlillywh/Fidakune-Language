# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create an intuitive workflow for community members to search the existing Fidakune lexicon and submit proposals for new words. The system will streamline the governance process outlined in REQUIREMENTS.md Section 4.4 by preventing duplicate suggestions and ensuring proposals are well-informed. This addresses a critical need in the Fidakune project's community governance model by providing a user-friendly interface that connects lexicon discovery with the proposal submission process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a community member interested in contributing vocabulary, I want to search the existing lexicon before proposing new words, so that I can avoid duplicate suggestions and build upon existing vocabulary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the lexicon search interface THEN the system SHALL display a single-page web application with a prominent search bar
2. WHEN a user enters a search query (English or Fidakune) THEN the system SHALL search the LEXICON.md file as the single source of truth
3. WHEN the search query exactly matches an existing Fidakune word or English definition THEN the system SHALL display the complete lexicon entry for that word
4. WHEN the search query does not return an exact match THEN the system SHALL perform root analysis to identify potential Fidakune roots within the query
5. WHEN root analysis finds matching components THEN the system SHALL display existing words that use those roots under a "Related Words" section
6. WHEN no exact match is found THEN the system SHALL perform semantic analysis by searching English definition fields for keywords from the user's query
7. WHEN semantic matches are found THEN the system SHALL display those results clearly labeled as "Related Words"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a community member who has searched the lexicon, I want to easily submit a new word proposal, so that I can contribute to the language's vocabulary expansion through the established governance process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search results are displayed (or no results found) THEN the system SHALL show a prominent "Propose a New Word" button
2. WHEN a user clicks the "Propose a New Word" button THEN the system SHALL open a new GitHub Issue in the Fidakune repository
3. WHEN the GitHub Issue opens THEN the system SHALL use a pre-populated issue template with required fields
4. WHEN the issue template loads THEN it SHALL include fields for "Proposed Fidakune Word", "English Definition", "Component Roots (if any)", and "Justification/Usage Example"
5. WHEN the issue template loads THEN it SHALL include a mandatory checkbox stating "I have searched the lexicon and believe this concept is not covered"
6. WHEN a user submits the issue THEN it SHALL be properly tagged and routed to the Fidakune Language Council for review

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the lexicon search system to be hosted on GitHub Pages and integrate seamlessly with our existing infrastructure, so that it requires minimal maintenance while providing reliable service to the community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL be hosted on GitHub Pages as a single-page web application
2. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL parse the LEXICON.md file directly from the repository as its data source
3. WHEN LEXICON.md is updated THEN the search application SHALL reflect those changes without requiring separate updates
4. WHEN users access the application THEN it SHALL load quickly and work on both desktop and mobile devices
5. WHEN the application encounters errors THEN it SHALL display helpful error messages and fallback options
6. WHEN the GitHub integration is used THEN it SHALL properly authenticate users and create issues with appropriate permissions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a community member with accessibility needs, I want the lexicon search interface to be fully accessible, so that I can participate in vocabulary development regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL comply with WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN all interface elements SHALL have appropriate labels and descriptions
3. WHEN navigating with keyboard only THEN all functionality SHALL be accessible via keyboard shortcuts
4. WHEN search results are displayed THEN they SHALL be announced to screen readers with clear context
5. WHEN the "Propose a New Word" button is activated THEN the action SHALL be clearly communicated to assistive technologies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a linguist reviewing word proposals, I want submissions to include comprehensive search evidence, so that I can quickly assess whether the proposed word fills a genuine gap in the lexicon.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches before proposing THEN the system SHALL log their search terms and results
2. WHEN a GitHub issue is created THEN it SHALL include a summary of the search performed
3. WHEN related words are found during search THEN the issue SHALL reference those existing terms
4. WHEN no related words are found THEN the issue SHALL indicate that a comprehensive search was performed
5. WHEN the mandatory checkbox is checked THEN it SHALL serve as confirmation that due diligence was performed
