# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GitHub-native lexicon management system will replace the current external website approach with a streamlined workflow that leverages GitHub's native features. This system will enable community members to submit new word proposals through GitHub Issue Forms and provide automated analysis through GitHub Actions, creating a more integrated and maintainable solution for the Fidakune language project.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Fidakune community member, I want to submit new word proposals directly through GitHub, so that I can contribute to the lexicon without needing to navigate to external websites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the GitHub repository THEN the system SHALL provide a clear "New Word Proposal" option in the Issues section
2. WHEN a user clicks "New Word Proposal" THEN the system SHALL present a structured form with all required fields
3. WHEN a user submits a proposal THEN the system SHALL automatically create an issue with proper labels and formatting
4. IF a user leaves required fields empty THEN the system SHALL prevent submission and display validation messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a language contributor, I want to provide structured information about my word proposal, so that reviewers have all necessary details to evaluate the submission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting a proposal THEN the system SHALL require the proposed word in Latin alphabet format
2. WHEN submitting a proposal THEN the system SHALL require a clear English definition
3. WHEN submitting a proposal THEN the system SHALL require selection from predefined semantic domains
4. WHEN submitting a proposal THEN the system SHALL require justification and etymology explanation
5. IF the word is a compound THEN the system SHALL require explanation of how meaning derives from roots

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Language Council member, I want automated analysis of new proposals, so that I can quickly identify potential issues and focus my review time effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new proposal issue is created THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger analysis within 5 minutes
2. WHEN analysis runs THEN the system SHALL check phonotactic validity against official Fidakune phonemes
3. WHEN analysis runs THEN the system SHALL identify potential homophone conflicts with existing words
4. WHEN analysis runs THEN the system SHALL verify that compound word roots exist in the lexicon
5. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL post results as a comment on the proposal issue

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Language Council member, I want clear, formatted analysis results, so that I can quickly understand the automated review findings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis results are posted THEN the system SHALL use clear pass/warning/fail indicators
2. WHEN phonotactic issues are found THEN the system SHALL specify which phonemes or clusters are invalid
3. WHEN homophone conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL list similar existing words with their definitions
4. WHEN compound root issues exist THEN the system SHALL identify which roots are missing from the lexicon
5. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary recommendation (approve/review/reject)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want the system to integrate seamlessly with existing GitHub workflows, so that it doesn't disrupt current development processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL use only standard GitHub features (Issues, Actions, Forms)
2. WHEN proposals are submitted THEN they SHALL appear in the standard Issues interface with appropriate labels
3. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL not interfere with other GitHub Actions or workflows
4. IF the analysis script fails THEN the system SHALL log errors without breaking the GitHub Action
5. WHEN the system accesses lexicon data THEN it SHALL use the existing lexicon_enhanced.json file format

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want clear separation of concerns between form definition, workflow automation, and analysis logic, so that I can maintain and update each component independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the system THEN the GitHub Issue Form SHALL be defined in a separate YAML file
2. WHEN implementing the system THEN the GitHub Action workflow SHALL be defined in a separate YAML file  
3. WHEN implementing the system THEN the analysis logic SHALL be contained in a dedicated Python script
4. WHEN updating form fields THEN changes SHALL not require modifications to the workflow or analysis script
5. WHEN updating analysis logic THEN changes SHALL not require modifications to the form or workflow definitions
