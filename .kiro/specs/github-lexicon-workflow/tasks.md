- [ ] 6. Create comprehensive analysis report generator
  - Implement structured markdown output with pass/warning/fail indicators
  - Add detailed error messages with specific phoneme or root issues
  - Create recommendation system (approve/review/reject) based on analysis results
  - Format output for optimal readability in GitHub issue comments
  - Write unit tests for report generation with various analysis scenarios
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [x] 7. Create GitHub Actions workflow






  - Create `.github/workflows/lexicon_bot.yml` with proper trigger conditions

  - _Requirements: 3.1, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_




- [ ] 8. Implement comprehensive error handling and edge cases
  - Add graceful handling for missing lexicon or phonology files
  - Implement fallback behavior when analysis script fails
  - Create informative error messages for various failure scenarios

  - Add input sanitization to prevent markdown injection in comments
  - Write integration tests for error scenarios and edge cases
  - _Requirements: 5.4, 6.4, 6.5_

- [ ] 9. Create end-to-end integration tests
  - Write test cases that simulate complete workflow from issue creation to comment posting
  - Create test data with various proposal types (valid, invalid, edge cases)
  - Implement automated testing for GitHub Actions workflow functionality

  - Add performance tests to ensure analysis completes within reasonable time
  - Verify proper integration with existing lexicon and phonology files
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [ ] 10. Add semantic domain dropdown population
  - Extract semantic domains from existing lexicon_enhanced.json file
  - Update GitHub Issue Form with complete list of available domains
  - Ensure domain validation in analysis script matches form options
  - Add fallback handling for new domains not yet in the lexicon
  - Write tests to verify domain consistency between form and validation
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.4, 6.5_

- [x] 11. Implement final integration and documentation




  - Create comprehensive README section explaining the proposal workflow
  - Add inline code comments and documentation strings to analysis script
  - Verify all components work together in complete end-to-end workflow
