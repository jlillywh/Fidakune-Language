# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement a graph-based conceptual search engine that enables users to explore the semantic and structural relationships within the Fidakune lexicon. Unlike traditional keyword-based search, this system will visualize and navigate the conceptual network of the language, allowing users to discover word relationships, root connections, and semantic associations through an interactive graph traversal interface.

The system addresses the need for deeper lexical exploration in Fidakune, where compound words like "kore-pet" (grief = heart-stone) and "sole-lum" (hope = sun-light) create rich networks of meaning that benefit from visual and interactive exploration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want to explore conceptual relationships in the Fidakune lexicon, so that I can understand how words connect and discover related vocabulary through semantic networks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches for a concept THEN the system SHALL find the corresponding node(s) in the lexical graph
2. WHEN a starting node is identified THEN the system SHALL perform graph traversal to 1-2 degrees of separation
3. WHEN traversal is complete THEN the system SHALL display results grouped by relationship type
4. WHEN results are displayed THEN each result SHALL be clickable to trigger new searches
5. WHEN a new search is triggered THEN the system SHALL update the display with the new conceptual network
6. WHEN no matching nodes are found THEN the system SHALL provide helpful suggestions for alternative searches

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Fidakune Language Council member, I want to maintain a curated lexical graph data file, so that I can ensure the quality and accuracy of conceptual relationships in the search system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL load lexical_graph.json as the single source of truth
2. WHEN lexical_graph.json is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect changes without requiring code modifications
3. WHEN the graph data is loaded THEN the system SHALL validate node and edge structure integrity
4. WHEN invalid data is detected THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for correction
5. WHEN the Language Council updates relationships THEN the changes SHALL be immediately available to users
6. WHEN data loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide graceful fallback with error reporting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want a robust graph search engine, so that I can provide efficient and accurate conceptual search capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the search engine SHALL parse lexical_graph.json into an efficient in-memory graph representation
2. WHEN a search query is received THEN the engine SHALL identify matching starting nodes within 100ms
3. WHEN graph traversal begins THEN the engine SHALL use breadth-first search for consistent relationship discovery
4. WHEN traversal reaches maximum depth THEN the engine SHALL limit results to prevent performance degradation
5. WHEN results are collected THEN the engine SHALL organize them by relationship type (is_a, has_root, is_related_to)
6. WHEN multiple relationship paths exist THEN the engine SHALL preserve path information for UI display

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user exploring the lexicon, I want an intuitive interface that clearly visualizes conceptual relationships, so that I can easily understand and navigate the language network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search results are displayed THEN they SHALL be organized in a structured list with clear category headings
2. WHEN "is_a" relationships are found THEN they SHALL be displayed under "Directly Related Concepts"
3. WHEN "has_root" relationships are found THEN they SHALL be displayed under "Component Roots to Consider"
4. WHEN "is_related_to" relationships are found THEN they SHALL be displayed under "Related Ideas"
5. WHEN a user clicks any result item THEN it SHALL trigger a new search with that concept as the starting point
6. WHEN the interface updates THEN it SHALL maintain search history for navigation breadcrumbs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the graph-based search to be fully accessible, so that I can explore conceptual relationships regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interface loads THEN it SHALL comply with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible via Tab and Enter keys
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN relationship categories and connections SHALL be clearly announced
4. WHEN results update THEN screen readers SHALL be notified of changes through ARIA live regions
5. WHEN visual relationships are displayed THEN alternative text descriptions SHALL convey the same information
6. WHEN high contrast mode is enabled THEN all visual elements SHALL remain clearly distinguishable

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to explore conceptual relationships on my device, so that I can learn about Fidakune vocabulary anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing on mobile devices THEN the interface SHALL be fully responsive and touch-optimized
2. WHEN displaying relationship categories THEN they SHALL be easily readable on small screens
3. WHEN tapping result items THEN the touch targets SHALL be at least 44px for accessibility
4. WHEN the graph data loads THEN it SHALL be optimized for mobile network conditions
5. WHEN exploring relationships THEN the mobile interface SHALL provide smooth navigation between concepts
6. WHEN using mobile screen readers THEN all functionality SHALL work with VoiceOver and TalkBack

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the graph-based search to integrate seamlessly with existing Fidakune infrastructure, so that users have a cohesive experience across all tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the graph search THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing lexicon search workflow
2. WHEN concepts are explored THEN users SHALL have the option to propose new relationships through GitHub
3. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL use the same hosting and security infrastructure as other tools
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled consistently with existing error handling patterns
5. WHEN performance is measured THEN it SHALL meet the same standards as the current lexicon search
6. WHEN documentation is provided THEN it SHALL follow the established documentation standards
