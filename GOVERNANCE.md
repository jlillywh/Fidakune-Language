# Fidakune Governance Model

## Our Philosophy

Fidakune is a language for everyone, built by everyone. Our governance model is designed to be transparent, community-driven, and focused on maintaining the long-term vision and stability of the language. This document outlines the phased approach to project leadership, the responsibilities of the future Fidakune Language Council, and the process for community involvement, as aligned with REQUIREMENTS.md.

## Project Leadership and Phased Governance

To ensure a cohesive vision during its critical early stages, Fidakune will follow a two-phase governance model.

### Phase 1: Founder-Led Development (Current Stage)

During the initial development, launch, and community-building phase, the project is under the direction of the **Project Founder**.

* **Executive Authority:** The Project Founder holds final decision-making authority on all aspects of the language design, project direction, and initial documentation to ensure a consistent and rapid development cycle.

* **Focus:** The primary goal of this phase is to establish the core language, publish the foundational learning materials, and foster an initial community of contributors.

### Phase 2: Transition to Delegated Governance

As the project gains momentum and achieves key milestones (such as the adoption metrics outlined in REQUIREMENTS.md), the Project Founder will initiate the transition to a delegated governance model. This involves the formation of the Fidakune Language Council to assume stewardship of the language.

## The Fidakune Language Council (Future Governing Body)

The Fidakune Language Council will be the primary stewardship body responsible for guiding the evolution of the language once the project transitions to Phase 2. Its role is not to dictate, but to facilitate community consensus and ensure all changes align with Fidakune's core design principles.

### Responsibilities

The Council will be responsible for:

* **Overseeing Vocabulary Expansion:** Reviewing and formally approving new word proposals that have achieved community consensus (e.g., sky-net for internet).
* **Maintaining Phonetic Integrity:** Ensuring new words adhere to the established phonotactic rules and do not create homophones.
* **Guiding Evolution:** Proposing and ratifying updates to the language or its components (e.g., gestures) every two years, based on global usage trends and community feedback.
* **Upholding the Vision:** Acting as the final guardian of the core principles outlined in the REQUIREMENTS.md document.
* **Moderating Disputes:** Serving as the final point of appeal for community moderation issues.

### Composition

The Fidakune Language Council will consist of five members to ensure a balance of expertise and community representation:

* **1 Linguist:** To provide academic and technical expertise.
* **1 Accessibility Expert:** To ensure the language and its tools remain inclusive, per WCAG 2.1 standards.
* **3 Community Representatives:** To represent the voice and needs of Fidakune learners and users.

### Council Selection and Terms

* **Initial Council Formation:** To initiate Phase 2, the Project Founder will appoint the first five members of the Council based on their expertise and contributions to the project.
* **Term Limits:** All council members serve two-year terms.
* **Community Elections:** Following the initial term, all council positions will be filled via a public election process open to active community members. The specifics of the election process will be defined and ratified by the first Council in collaboration with the community by Month 12 (Year 1).

### Transparency

All major decisions made by the Fidakune Language Council will be documented and made publicly accessible in a dedicated section of the digital lexicon platform or the main GitHub repository, adhering to WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards.

## Community Contribution Process

The community drives Fidakune's growth. The standard process for proposing changes is as follows:

1. **Proposal:** A community member opens an Issue on the GitHub Issues tab with a detailed proposal (e.g., for a new word). Non-technical users can email [fidakune-contact@example.com].
2. **Discussion:** The community discusses the proposal in the Issue thread, offering feedback and suggestions.
3. **Consensus:** If a rough consensus is reached, the proposal is flagged for review.
4. **Ratification:** During Phase 1, the Project Founder makes the final decision. In Phase 2, the Council formally reviews and ratifies the proposal.
5. **Implementation:** The change is merged into the official lexicon, documentation, or learning tools.

As the project gains momentum and achieves key milestones (such as the adoption metrics outlined in `REQUIREMENTS.md`), the Project Founder will initiate the transition to a delegated governance model. This involves the formation of the Fidakune Language Council to assume stewardship of the language.
