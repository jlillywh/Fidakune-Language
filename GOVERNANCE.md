# Fidakune Governance Model

## Our Philosophy

Fidakune is a language for everyone, built by everyone. Our governance model is designed to be transparent, community-driven, and focused on maintaining the long-term vision and stability of the language. This document outlines the structure and responsibilities of the Fidakune Language Council and the process for community involvement.

## The Fidakune Language Council

The Fidakune Language Council is the primary stewardship body responsible for guiding the evolution of the language. Its role is not to dictate, but to facilitate community consensus and ensure all changes align with Fidakune's core design principles.

### Responsibilities

The Council is responsible for:

* **Overseeing Vocabulary Expansion:** Reviewing and formally approving new word proposals that have achieved community consensus.
* **Maintaining Phonetic Integrity:** Ensuring new words adhere to the established phonotactic rules and do not create homophones.
* **Guiding Evolution:** Proposing and ratifying updates to the language or its components (e.g., gestures) every two years, based on global usage trends and community feedback.
* **Upholding the Vision:** Acting as the final guardian of the core principles outlined in the `REQUIREMENTS.md` document.
* **Moderating Disputes:** Serving as the final point of appeal for community moderation issues.

### Composition

The Fidakune Language Council will consist of **five members** to ensure a balance of expertise and community representation:

* **1 Linguist:** To provide academic and technical expertise.
* **1 Accessibility Expert:** To ensure the language and its tools remain inclusive.
* **3 Community Representatives:** To represent the voice and needs of Fidakune learners and users.

### Council Selection and Terms

* **Initial Council (Years 1-2):** The first five members will be appointed by the core Fidakune project team based on their expertise and early contributions to the project.
* **Term Limits:** All council members serve **two-year terms**.
* **Community Elections (Year 3 Onward):** Beginning in Year 3, all council positions will be filled via a public election process open to active community members. The specifics of the election process will be defined and ratified by the first Council in collaboration with the community.

### Transparency

All major decisions made by the Fidakune Language Council will be documented and made **publicly accessible** in a dedicated section of the digital lexicon platform or the main GitHub repository.

## Community Contribution Process

The community drives Fidakune's growth. The standard process for proposing changes is as follows:

1.  **Proposal:** A community member opens an Issue on GitHub with a detailed proposal (e.g., for a new word).
2.  **Discussion:** The community discusses the proposal in the Issue thread, offering feedback and suggestions.
3.  **Consensus:** If a rough consensus is reached, the proposal is flagged for Council review.
4.  **Ratification:** The Council formally reviews the proposal for alignment with Fidakune's principles and, if approved, ratifies it.
5.  **Implementation:** The change is merged into the official lexicon, documentation, or learning tools.
