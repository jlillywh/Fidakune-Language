# Fidakune Phonology

This document serves as the single source of truth for the Fidakune sound system, providing comprehensive guidance on phonemes, pronunciation, stress patterns, and syllable structure. Fidakune's phonological design prioritizes **articulatory ease** and **acoustic distinctiveness** to ensure accessibility for speakers from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

## Introduction

Fidakune's phonological system is built on two fundamental principles outlined in Section 3 of REQUIREMENTS.md:

- **Articulatory Ease:** All phonemes are selected for ease of production across all human speakers, avoiding sounds that are difficult or impossible for certain populations.
- **Acoustic Distinctiveness:** Sounds are chosen to be clearly distinguishable from one another, minimizing confusion and maximizing communication clarity.

The 20-phoneme inventory includes sounds common across global languages while avoiding region-specific phonemes, ensuring universal accessibility for the language's role as a shared second language for global communication.

## Phoneme Inventory

Fidakune employs a minimal inventory of exactly 20 phonemes: 15 consonants and 5 vowels. This restricted set reduces cognitive load while maintaining sufficient distinctiveness for clear communication.

## Syllable Structure and Phonotactics

Fidakune employs a simplified syllable structure to maximize ease of pronunciation and processing.

### Basic Syllable Structure
Most Fidakune syllables follow a simple Consonant-Vowel (CV) pattern, ensuring smooth articulation and clear acoustic boundaries between syllables.

### Permitted Consonant Clusters
A limited set of consonant clusters is permitted exclusively in the onset of the second syllable in two-syllable words:

- /st/ - as in hypothetical `a-sta`
- /pl/ - as in hypothetical `e-pla`  
- /pr/ - as in hypothetical `o-pra`
- /tr/ - as in hypothetical `u-tra`
- /sp/ - as in hypothetical `i-spa`

**Important:** These clusters are only permitted in the onset of the second syllable in two-syllable words. They cannot appear word-initially, word-finally, or in any other position.

### Examples
- **Simple syllables:** `a-mi` (friend), `ko-re` (heart), `so-le` (sun)
- **With permitted clusters:** `a-stra`, `e-spla` (hypothetical examples)

## Stress

Fidakune employs a fixed, predictable stress system to eliminate memorization burden for learners.

### Stress Rule
Stress always falls on the penultimate (second-to-last) syllable in multi-syllabic words.

### Examples
- `a-mi` → **a**.mi (friend)
- `ko-re` → **ko**.re (heart)  
- `a-qua` → **a**.qua (water)
- `fi-da-ku-ne` → fi.da.**ku**.ne (the language name)
- `Pa-ris` → **Pa**.ris (Paris - proper noun adaptation)

### Check Your Understanding: Stress Rules

1. Where would stress fall in the word `ami-ko` (friendly)?
2. How would you pronounce `kore-pet` (grief/heart-stone) with correct stress?
3. If a new word `solestra` were added to Fidakune, where would the stress fall?

## Special Phonological Rules

### /ɾ/ Accessibility Rule
The alveolar tap /ɾ/ can be approximated as /d/ or /r/ for speakers who find this sound difficult to produce. This accommodation ensures the language remains accessible to speakers from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

**Examples:**
- `kore` /ˈko.ɾe/ may be pronounced as /ˈko.de/ or /ˈko.re/
- `kore-pet` /ˈko.ɾe.pet/ may be pronounced as /ˈko.de.pet/ or /ˈko.re.pet/

### Tones and Length
Fidakune is strictly **non-tonal**. Pitch variations may be used for prosodic emphasis or emotional expression, but they do not change lexical meaning.

Fidakune does not use phonemic vowel or consonant length to distinguish words. All phonemes should be pronounced with consistent, moderate length.

## Check Your Understanding: Phonotactics

1. Is the word `spami` a valid Fidakune word? Explain why or why not.
2. Could `astra` be a valid two-syllable Fidakune word? What about `stra`?
3. Break down the syllable structure of these hypothetical words: `kopla`, `mistral`, `aspro`.
